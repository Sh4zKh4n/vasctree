## Introduction ##
vasctree is a Python http://www.python.org project based for generating graph representations of vascular trees segmented from 3D medical images.

## Dependencies ##
While primarily written in Python, the core processing in vasctree makes use of a number of third party libraries and tools.

  * numpy http://www.numpy.org/
  * scipy http://www.scipy.org/
  * Cython http://www.cython.org/

In addition there are a number of visualization and editing tools that rely on a different set of third party packages.
  * matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/
  * mayavi3d http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/
## Contributors ##
The development of vasctree was funded in part by NIH grant [R01](https://code.google.com/p/vasctree/source/detail?r=01) HL087119 "Automated Detection of Thromboembolic Disease in CT Images." Contributors to this project include the following:

  * Brian Chapman, PhD
  * Holly Berty, PhD
  * Xiaofei Song, PhD
  * Luisa Leong, B.S.
  * Alex Sullivan, B.S.
  * Sean Lee, M.D.
